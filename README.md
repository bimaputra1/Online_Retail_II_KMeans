# RFM Customer Segmentation using KMeans

The aim of this project is to do customer segmentation analysis from online retail II dataset from UCI ML repository. This analysis will focus on getting RFM values and clustering it using K-Means algorithms.

Customer segmentation is a method to grouping customers based on desired criteria. In this project the customers was divided into some groups based on their recency, frequency and monetary value. Recency is about when the last time customers make an order. It means the number of days since a customer made the last purcase. Frequency is the total number of customer purcase in a given period. Then monetary is the total amount of money customer spent in that period. These three values that are used as features to conduct K-Means clustering.

Several step was taken to complete this project. First is prepare the library and download the required dataset. Then the raw data are cleaned up and scaled use standardization and normalization prior to modelling. Furthermore the optimum values of cluster was determined by produced an elbow plot. Lastly the modelling was performed and summarized the results.
